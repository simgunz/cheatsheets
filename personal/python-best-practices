# Paths
- Use pathlib
- Prefer PurePath when you do not need to perform I/O operations

# Temp files and folders
- tempfile.TemporaryFile
- tempfile.TemporaryDirectory
- Can be used as context manager

# Docstrings
- Use triple double quotes

# Method ordering
- __init__ first
- public before private
- properties before methods
- classmethod > staticmethod > method
- top down: high level methods first
